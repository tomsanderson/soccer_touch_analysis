# Narration Guide – V2
How to Talk to the Soccer Touch Analysis System

This document explains **how humans should narrate events** in V2.

If you are worrying about phrasing, speed, or structure — you are doing too much.

## Core Principle

> Talk like a coach explaining what just happened to another coach.

Do NOT:
- Speak fast
- Follow templates
- Worry about exact wording

---

## Primary Workflow: Play–Pause Story Mode (Default)

### How It Works

1. Play ~10–20 seconds of video
2. Pause the video
3. Calmly describe what happened in natural language
4. Resume playback and repeat

### Example Narration

> “Blue seven takes a really good first touch, keeps control, and then plays a safe two-touch pass back to Blue three. Blue three tries to play a forward ball but it’s intercepted. Seven immediately presses and actually wins it back.”

This single narration may produce:
- a first-touch event
- an on-ball action
- a loss of possession
- a post-loss reaction

That is expected.

## Alternative Workflow: Marker First, Describe Later

### Pass 1 — Mark Moments

- While watching at speed, tap a key or button whenever:
  - A meaningful touch occurs
  - A mistake or decision stands out
- No narration required

### Pass 2 — Describe Calmly

- For each marker, watch a short clip
- Describe what happened in natural language

This mode minimizes interruption during viewing.

## What You Do NOT Need to Say

You do NOT need to say:
- Event names (“first touch”, “on-ball action”)
- Field names
- Touch counts in a specific format
- Exact outcomes (“possession_after_touch”)

The system will infer these.

---

## What Helps the System (Optional, Not Required)

If it feels natural, you MAY mention:
- Player numbers or names
- Obvious intent (“safe”, “risky”, “panicked”)
- Reaction quality (“great press”, “gives up”, “hesitates”)

But nothing is mandatory.

---

## Summary

If narration feels stressful, unnatural, or rushed — stop and slow down.

V2 is explicitly designed so that **you never have to narrate faster than you can think**.
